<h4>Maps and Plans Collection</h4>
<p>The Architecture Library's Maps and Plans Collection contains an assortment of architectural drawings including floor and site plans, maps, elevations, sections, and renderings. Most of the items are professionally bound working drawings while other buildings are displayed on single sheets. The file drawers are labeled A through T and organized by location. The first drawers hold drawings of buildings on the University of Notre Dame campus and from there spread out to South Bend, Indiana and Chicago, Illinois. Drawings from the rest of the United States follow. European and other worldly buildings can be found at the end of the collection along with a selection of architectural writings and exhibit materials.</p>
